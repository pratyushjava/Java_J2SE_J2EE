Internationalization -- i18n -- Technique for developing applications that support multiple languages, data formats  , currency formats , date formats etc without having to re-write prog logic.

Localization --- l10n --- technique for adapting an internationalized appln to support a specific locale.
Locale = specific geographical,political or cultural region.

Struts has inherent support for i18n & l10n

Steps for i18n
1. Identify the locales(here only applying for different languages & different char scripts)
2. Create text-based property file -- one per each locale. ---store it under <src>
Rule --- for global mesages --- i.e common to all actions
add following constant in struts.xml
<constant name="struts.custom.i18n.resources" value="global" />
If value used is global --- then create property files --- global.properties -- mandatory
& then create copies using suffix as languagecode_countrycode
3. Don't hardcode UI component labels --- instead take them from prperties files
eg <s:textfield key="global.username" name="username" />


4. To changes the locale ---- i18n interceptor accepts 1 param 
request_locale --- this must be set to --- languagecode_countrycode

eg --- <s:url var="localeEN" namespace="/locale" action="locale1" >
   <s:param name="request_locale" >en</s:param>
</s:url>


& then can use link/select option list for allowing user to chose labels
eg : <s:a href="%{localeEn}">English </s:a>
If user presses English --- http://localhost:9090/test_struts/locale/locale1?request_locale=en



eg URL ---http://localhost:9090/day10_struts/locale/locale.action

---request_locale=en ---processed  by i18n interceptor ---searches under <web-inf>/classes ---global_en.properties & tries to find value of key=global.username

 

For non english char sets --- eg --- devnagari scripts , chinese or korean 
Below given are the additional steps


1. Link http://www.google.com/transliterate/Marathi
2. Type in English & see that it gets phonetically translated in Marathi
3. Copy it under notepad --- eg marathi.txt (while saving  --save as -- choose encoding --- UTF-8
4. Now for converting it from native ---- UTF 8 
use Java tool 
native2ascii -encoding UTF-8 marathi.txt output.txt
5. For Marathi --- locale setting to use is mr_IN
Create copy of properties file with this suffix & run code.
